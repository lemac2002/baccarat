## About
Baccarat Game made with Godot

## Theory
The game developed will hold around the same probabilities as the ones shown in class (Player: 0.44625, Banker: 0.4586, Tie: 0.09515. The game is based on an eight deck version of baccarat without commission. The decks are shuffled using a pseudo-random algorithm known as Fisher-Yates. Fisher-Yates works by iteratively swapping the last unshuffled element with a randomly selected element from the unshuffled portion of the array. This process continues until the first element is reached. The randomness is generated using a deterministic pseudo-random number generator, which ensures that each number is produced in constant time.
